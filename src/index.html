            <p>
              I am a 23-year-old full-stack web developer with a strong focus on
              frontend development. I specialise in Vue and React. I am a strong
              advocate for TypeScript, valuing its ability to enhance code
              quality and maintainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for software development began at an early age, and I
              have been exploring various programming languages since I was 12.
              Over the years, I have experimented with web, game, and mobile
              application development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software development has always been a keen interest of mine. I
              have been experimenting with all sorts of programming languages
              since I was 12 years old, in areas including web development, game
              development, and mobile application development.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my most notable achievements is a mobile game I developed
              at 15 using Unity, which has accumulated over 600,000 downloads on
              the Google Play Store. At its peak, it was receiving more than
              50,000 downloads per month.

              I joined GivEnergy in March 2024 as a mid-level full-stack
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              GivEnergy is the UK's top provider of residential battery storage
              systems. They supply the hardware and software to empower
              homeowners to take control of their energy usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently leading the frontend development of a new
              cross-platform mobile application, leveraging React, Tailwind,
              Ionic, and Capacitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my development work, I mentor junior developers and
              support the professional growth of the team by providing guidance
              on TypeScript, React, CSS, and key aspects of modern web
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also working on a new serverless event-driven service that
              ingests IoT data and calculates energy usage in near real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on this service has taught me an enormous amount about AWS
              and the structure of complex backend systems.

            </p>
            <p>
              While my primary focus was on frontend development using Vue,
              Vuetify, and Sass, my role expanded over time to include backend
              development with C# and PostgreSQL.

              This application parsed an image of a maze, with a start and end

              between the two points. It also rendered the path finding process
